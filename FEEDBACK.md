- [ ] Has implementations of multiple basic Fibonacci algorithms but don't have [matrix exponentiation](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Fibonacci_matrix-exponentiation#Matrix_exponentiation_2) or phi approximations.
- [x] Has some wrong claims in the comments - recursive algorithm is not O(n) complex, it's O(2^n).
- [ ] Kubernetes part is basic, doesn't do health checks even though the service has health check endpoint.

Besides that, the code structure is actually really nice and reminds me how one would do a longer-term web service project, not a two-hour exercise. Most importantly it shows familiarity and experience with Go.
